# About
The aim of this project is to build a predictive machine learning tool to classify the loan defaulters and non-defaulters based on their profile. It is important for investors and lenders to know their borrower so they could determine the chances of getting their funds back before lending the money. Lenders, investors could use this model to decide whether a borrower is a fit for sanctioning a loan or not.
